# 4 principles

# Encapsulation
# Restricting direct access to attributes
# For example: not allowing an attribute to be changed after initialisation
# Or limiting what values it can be set too, such as word length or only positive numbers
# Or using methods to change the attribute rather than doing it directly
# E.g. giving it a multiplier rather than a final new value

# Abstraction
# Only showing necessary attributes and data, the rest is hidden
# E.g. only showing the result to the user, rather than each step

# Inheritance
# Reusing code from a parent class in the child class
# Child inherits features from parents

# Polymorphism
# Ability to have different scenarios when calling the same entity
# For example, the len() function, this can handle many types of objects: strings, lists etc.
# This is a great example as this function can serve multiple purposes depending on the type of object
